        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a diligent and motivated worker, and when I do a job I want it done right. Communication is my strong point both verbally and in writing.<br>
            I am well spoken and can communicate with a wide range of people, which I believe is a valuable quality in any line of work.<br>
            I excel in both working in a team and individually and also will never be shy of taking a leadership role.<br>
            I display resilience when I work and will never avoid responsibility for my actions. I give full thought and attention to jobs I am assigned, and will give my best in all I do.
